# My First PCB ü¶å

_Design a printed circuit board to get you started in the world of electronics design and small scale manufacturing!_

## Why PCB's? ü§î

* Maybe you‚Äôve been building up your own circuits on a breadboard for a while now, and maybe soldering some of them onto strip-board, but want to make them look nicer.
* You want things to be more robust, professional and safe to help with product development or your own systems.
* You‚Äôve seen designs on the internet and need help to make it or adapt it yourself.
* You need to design your own printed circuit boards!

It‚Äôs easier than you think!

This course is built to give you an understanding of the basic fundamentals in electronics production with KiCad using MCQN Ltd‚Äôs experience designing and developing products, systems and the Internet of Things. Everything from cuff-links, dust sensors, Museum installations and internet connected bells, LED drivers and bubble machines.

Start off by running through the basics in [Designing my first #BadgeLife](DesigningMyFirstBadgeLife) and then choose your own route through the remaining tutorials based on what you're looking to build.

## Lessons üß©

 * [Designing my first #BadgeLife](DesigningMyFirstBadgeLife).  The basics, from breadboard to ordering PCBs.
 * [Adding Artwork](AddingArtwork).  Every board deserves a logo!
 * [Making Footprints](MakingFootprints) or "I want to use a part that isn't in the library!"
 * [Now Available In 3D](NowAvailableIn3D).  Making 3D models of your board (and creating 3D models for parts without them)

We've also written some notes on other things to consider, such as how to share your design, thoughts on supply chains and other considerations, in [ResponsibleElectronics](ResponsibleElectronics).

## FAQs üßê

### What version of KiCad do I need?

The guide was last tested with [KiCad (5.1.9)-1](https://www.kicad.org/download/), and should work with version 5. Earlier versions may have slightly different features and menus/windows.

### Do I need any previous experience?

You‚Äôll need to have some experience and literacy building and prototyping simple electronic circuits using low voltage batteries and breadboards. You may have built some basic Arduino projects or experimented with powering or controlling LEDs or other electronics. You may have already built simple electronic sensors and now want to make more robust custom ‚Äòbreakout‚Äô boards.

## Some Inspiration ‚ú®

Some links to the awesome PCB art that others have made:

 * [TwinkleTwinkle](https://hackaday.io/twinkletwinkie), for example: [his PCB sphinx](https://twitter.com/mrtwinkletwink/status/1160037616240287744) or [Arc Badge](https://twitter.com/mrtwinkletwink/status/1201966802512830464)
 * [Boldport](https://boldport.com/) use different software (that they wrote themselves) for their PCB designs, but are definitely redefining what's possible with PCBs.  Such as [this interesting 3D stacked design](https://boldport.com/blog/2017/2/7/what-boldport-club-members-say) or [Monarch Butterfly](https://www.eurocircuits.com/blog/why-working-together-works-for-us-both/)

## Alternative Guides üëÄ

We know that our guide isn't perfect for everyone, based on their level of experience and how far they want to go. If you are looking for something a bit different, there are good written guides that take different approaches:

### [Official KiCad 5.1 Getting Started Documentation](https://docs.kicad.org/5.1/en/getting_started_in_kicad/getting_started_in_kicad.html)
- Thorough, much more detailed, good reference but too much for most beginners as step 1.
- The workflow diagram might be a useful reference to get an overview of the software, since KiCad is a combination of originally separate programs.

### [hawk by Mike Watts](https://github.com/MalphasWats/hawk)
- Written and published in a similar style to our guide, but a step up in complexity and based around an ARM dev board.
- Very clearly explained and organised. It's a great guide!

### [KiCad.info: Introduction to PCB Design](https://forum.kicad.info/t/tutorial-introduction-to-pcb-design-with-kicad-version-5-1-getting-started/20600)
- Nicely laid out in markdown. Writing is relatively technical.
- Recommended as a second tutorial after completing ours, since it is similar but goes into the weeds.

### [HackSpace Mag: Make a PCB in KiCad. Part 1 in Issue 17, Part 2 in Issue 18, both starting on page 80](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/17)
- Example is an electronic match.
- Well written though constrained by the magazine format.

### [Make Your First Printed Circuit Board](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/kicad-tutorial/)
- The most similar guide to ours, but is generalised - not for a specific circuit board).
- Very clearly written and formatted.
- Some commenters have been caught out by footprints.

### [Sparkfun: Beginner's Guide to KiCad](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/beginners-guide-to-kicad/all#kicad-project-window)
- Audience seems to be experienced PCB designers who are new to KiCad.
- Uses an example project of a UV sensor breakout board.
- Based on older version of KiCad - 4.0.6

If you have more time available and you like learning from videos, there are two well-reviewed guides:

### [Chris Gammell / Contextual Electronics: Getting to Blinky 5.0](https://contextualelectronics.com/courses/getting-to-blinky-5-0/)
- Very well reviewed and recommended by others.

### [Shawn Hymel / DigiKey: Introduction to KiCad](https://shawnhymel.com/portfolio/video-series-introduction-to-kicad/)
- 10 part series. Thorough, even including physical assembly.
- Note: Uses KiCad 4.1 so is slightly out of date.
