### Learn how to make your first Printed Circuit Board (PCB)!

Design a printed circuit board to get you started in the world of electronics design and small scale manufacturing. Designed to give you an understanding of some basic fundamentals in electronics production with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) using [MCQN Ltd](https://mcqn.com/)'s experience designing and developing products, systems and the Internet of Things. Everything from cufflinks, dust sensors, Museum installations and internet connected bells, LED drivers and bubble machines.

 * Maybe you've been building up your own circuits on a breadboard for a while now, and maybe soldering some of them onto stripboard, but want to make them look nicer.
 * You want things to be more robust, professional and safe to help with product development or your own systems.
 * You've seen designs on the internet and need help to make it or adapt it yourself.

#### You need to design your own printed circuit boards!

### It's easier than you think.

We'll start off running through the basic principles and workflow with a template project for a PCB Badge and then you can choose your own route through the remaining tutorials based on what you're looking to build.

## FAQs 🙋

### Do I need any previous experience?📜

You'll need to have some experience and literacy building and prototyping simple electronic circuits using low voltage batteries and breadboards. You may have built some basic [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) projects or experimented with powering or controlling LEDs or other electronics. You may have already built simple electronic sensors and now want to make more robust custom 'breakout' boards.

You'll use practical workshop notes, references and resources and a chance to share your ideas with fellow electronics enthusiasts and creatives while introducing you to the facilities and other members of the [DoESLiverpool](https://doesliverpool.com) community.
